# html-proxy-windows-issue

This is a very slight variation on the basic vanilla vite application using `pnpm create vite`. The only difference I have made is that I have exported a function from `src/main.js` and imported that function in the index.html and executed it. It should all act exactly the same.

I expect the tiny vitest test to succeed in ubuntu and macos, but then fail for windows.
